# Room-Occupancy-Counter-VHDL-FPGA-Simulation
This project implements a digital system in VHDL that accurately tracks the number of people in a room using two photocell-based binary sensors one at the entrance and one at the exit. The system maintains a running count of occupants, compares it against a programmable 8-bit maximum capacity, and activates a max capacity signal once it is reached.
